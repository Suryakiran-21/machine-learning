# Machine-Learning-</br >
Created a machine learning project for KIET Hackathon</br >

PROBLEM STATEMENT:</br >
Here we are going to take the previous employes dataset and analyze the probability of employes left the company and reasons why they left the company.</br >
so this will be helpfull inorder to reduce the employes leaving the company.</br >

PROCESS:</br >
1)Imported dataset by using pandas library.</br >
2)performed exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the employee dataset:</br >
  a.Handling missing variables</br >
  b.Numerical variables </br >
  c.categorial features</br >
  d.Visualized dataset using matplotlib and seaborn</br >
3)model building using XGBRFClassifier algorithm.</br >

outcome:</br >
EDA:</br >
-In terms of education employees with Masters degree are most likely to leave the company.</br >
-Employees who joined in recent year are most likely to leave the company. Maybe they are not satisfied with thier salary or their department work culture.</br >
-Employee from Pune are most likely to leave the company.</br >
-In terms of Salary , employee with PaymentTier 2 are most likely to leave the company.</br >
-Female employee are more likely to leave the company.</br >
-Most of the employee who were benched left the company.</br >
-As we analysed in joining year the employees with less experience are the one's who are leaving the company.</br >

CONCLUSION:</br >
By using XGBRFClassifier algorithm we got 87.54027926960258 % accuracy.</br >
